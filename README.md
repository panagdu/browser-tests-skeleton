# browser-tests-skeleton
A simple skeleton for running tests in the browser

**Setup**

    npm install
    
**Run**

    npm start

This command should open the default browser pointing to http://127.0.0.1:8080/. 

Currently there are two tests running. For demonstration purposes one is passing and one is failing. 

**Notes**

Runs with Node 4+.
